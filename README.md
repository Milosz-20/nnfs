# NNFS Code Along

My code and progress following the book [*Neural Networks from Scratch in Python*](https://nnfs.io/). The goal is to build a deep learning library step-by-step from the ground up to understand the underlying math and mechanics of neural networks. 

## Quick Start

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install numpy nnfs matplotlib
